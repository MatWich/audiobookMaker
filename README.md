# Notes

In order to try this app you have to add a pdf file to the folder called <b>pdfs</b> in the app directory.
The costam.pdf is an empty pdf(<i>dummy data just for keeping that one folder on gh</i>) so you will get an error if you test this app out using costam.pdf.  

If you want to convert some text to MP3 format on linux make sure that you have installed <b>espeak</b> and <b>ffmpeg</b>
